## 🎯 Project Overview

### What is Kalavpp?

**Kalavpp** is a comprehensive art commerce and creative services platform designed for the Indian market. It serves as a unified marketplace where:

- **Artists** can showcase and sell their work
- **Collectors** can discover and purchase authentic art
- **Commissioners** can request custom artwork
- **Learners** can book art workshops and classes

### The Problem We Solve

**Challenge:**
- Artists struggle to reach wider audiences and monetize their work
- Art buyers find it difficult to discover authentic, curated artworks
- No unified platform exists for both art commerce and creative services
- Existing platforms are either e-commerce OR services, not both

**Our Solution:**
A dual-purpose platform that seamlessly integrates:
1. **E-Commerce** - Buy physical art, prints, merchandise, digital art
2. **Creative Services** - Commission custom art, hire designers, book workshops
